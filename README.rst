Flask-Velox
===========

Velox is a set of classes & mixins to help rapidly build Flask applications.

What is it?
-----------

We use Flask a lot at `SOON_`_ and we needed a central code base to build tools,
classes, mixins and what not to help us rapidly build applications and CMS's
to go with it.

Its early days and probably doesn't do as much as the alternatives out there
but as the software we build with it grows the demands on Velox will grow and
therefore so will the software, so hopefully this will mature rather quickly.
