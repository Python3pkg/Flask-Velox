Flask-Velox Documentation
=========================

The idea behind ``Flask-Velox`` is to provide ready made View and Mixin classes
to help reapidly build Flask applications for both public and admin systems.

Here at `SOON_`_ we use Flask a lot and we wanted a
framework we could use across all our products to clients. As our products and
requirments grow so will ``Flask-Velox``. It is early days but the absolute
basics are there and we would love feedback and help to grow this further.
